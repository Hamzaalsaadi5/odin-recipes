Here, I've created an index page and separate files to store recipes for hamburgers, pizza, and lasagna.

The index page acts as a central hub for easy access to the recipes. It provides a user-friendly interface with links to the individual recipe files.

To make it more organized, I've created separate files for each recipe. You'll find a specific file for hamburgers, pizza, and lasagna. Each file contains a detailed recipe with step-by-step instructions.

Whether you're craving a juicy hamburger, a cheesy pizza, or a flavorful lasagna, you can simply click on the corresponding file to find the recipe you desire.
